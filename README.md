## About
This notebook aims at predictng the optimum no. of clusters and visualizing them from the given 'Iris' dataset. Simple K-Means Clustering is used to achieve the result. The inertia observed is 78.94 and the silhouette score observed is 0.5525.

## Getting Started
* Clone the repository. The notebook is written in Jupyter and the libraries have been locally installed.
* Install the required libraries using the command `pip install [library_name]`.
* For more information, refer to the [document](https://towardsdatascience.com/k-means-clustering-algorithm-applications-evaluation-methods-and-drawbacks-aa03e644b48a).
